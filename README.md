The visually challenged community faces significant barriers when it comes to accessing and managing email communication. 
Traditional email interfaces heavily rely on visual elements, making it challenging for visually impaired individuals to independently read, compose, and manage emails. 
The objective of this project is to develop a voice-based email system using Python that empowers visually challenged users to interact with their emails efficiently and seamlessly.
Voice-based email is a revolutionary technology designed to empower visually challenged individuals with an accessible and efficient means of sending, receiving, and managing emails.
By utilizing speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, this innovation aims to break down digital communication barriers and foster inclusivity, enabling visually impaired users to interact with emails using their voice and enhancing their productivity and independence in the digital age.
